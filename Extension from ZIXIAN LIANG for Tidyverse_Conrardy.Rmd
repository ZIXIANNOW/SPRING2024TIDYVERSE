### Assignment
Your task here is to Create an Example.  Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset. (25 points)

Data obtained from Kaggle website at "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/electric-vehicle-population-data"  It is in CSV format and located on my GitHub site at "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aconrard/DATA606/main/Tidyverse%20Project/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv"

```{r EVS}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aconrard/DATA606/main/Tidyverse%20Project/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv"
ev_data <- read.csv(url)
```

### Tidyverse Package-Tidyr ![Logo](C:/Users/para2/Documents/R_Working_Directory/tidyr_logo.png){width=10%}

For this assignment vignette we will be using the Tidyr package for R.  This package has various tools for reshaping and tidying data to perform data analysis and visualization.  There are some very powerful functions that can be leveraged from the package including pivot_longer, pivot_wider, splitting and combining cells, and creating, reshaping, and transforming nested data.

### Data Source and Selection

The dataset selected is available on the Kaggle website and provides data on Electric Vehicles in the state of Washington.  This dataset lends itself readily for tidying and transforming with the Tidyr package. There 17 variables that include county, city, year, make, model of car, electric vehicle type. There are over 135,000 observations.

### Tibble Function

While the Tibble function is not contained within the Tidyr package, it is contained within the overall Tidyverse library.  We could of course use the "glimpse" or "view" functions to get a look at the dataset; however, the overall size of the dataset makes viewing problematic, and the glimpse function not visually optimal.  The tibble function allows for better visualization of the dataset, and also allows us to select columns for a new data frame and present it as a table.

```{r data}
as_tibble(ev_data)
```

### Variable Selection

We want to know the electric range and types of EV vehicles, and the county, model, make and year of the vehicles.  So we will narrow down the dataset to include only those columns for further transformation.

```{r Variable Selection}
ev_data_select <- ev_data |> select(County, Model.Year, Make, Model, Electric.Vehicle.Type, Electric.Range)
tibble(ev_data_select)
```

### Unite Function

The "unite" function allows us to collapse cells across several columns.  For example, we would like to collapse the model year, make, and model into a single column variable called EV_vehicle.
```{r unite, warning=FALSE}
ev_data_unite <- ev_data_select |> unite("EV_vehicle", Model.Year:Make:Model, sep = " ", na.rm = TRUE)
tibble(ev_data_unite)
```

### Separate Function

The "separate" function is a complement to the "unite" function and allows us to make the dataset wider or longer.  For this example we will separate the Electric.Vehicle.Type column into two separate columns names "EV_type_desc" and "EV_type_abbrev".  We will also remove the associated parentheses using the base package "gsub" function by replacing the ")" with "". 
```{r separate_wider_delim}
ev_data_sep <- ev_data_unite |>separate_wider_delim(Electric.Vehicle.Type, delim = "(", names = c("EV_type_desc", "EV_type_abbrev"))
ev_data_sep$EV_type_abbrev <- gsub("\\)","", ev_data_sep$EV_type_abbrev)
tibble(ev_data_sep)
```

### Pivot_Wider Function

The pivot_wider function allows us to expand the data frame variables to visualize the data contained in a specific column.  For this example we are going to clean up the data a little before we pivot the data frame.  We are going to remove any rows that have missing data in the County variable.  We are then only going to look at the counties in Washington state, of which there are thirty_nine (39).  And then we are going to look at the model years of 2011 through 2023 for the EV cars purchased in each of those counties.  

```{r grouping, warning=FALSE}
ev_data_clean <- ev_data[-c(150,116885,124299,126013,126132,130434,131492,131587),]
ev_data_count <- ev_data_clean |> filter(State == "WA", Model.Year >= 2011 & Model.Year < 2024) |> group_by(County, Model.Year) |> summarise(count=n())
ev_data_wider <- ev_data_count |> pivot_wider(, names_from = Model.Year, values_from = count)
kable(ev_data_wider, format = "html", caption = "EV Model Year by County") |> kable_classic_2()
```

### Conclusion

While this a relatively simple dataset to work with, it gives a person the opportunity to experiment with the various functions of the the Tidyr package within the Tidyverse.  Other functions available can allow the data frame to be nested using various dplyr and purr functions.

## Extension From ZIXIAN LIANG

I plan to transform the original data from wide format to long format first. Specifically, I will use the pivot_longer() function from Tidyr package to reshape the data, where each row represents a county, a year, and its corresponding value. Then, I will create a line plot using the ggplot() function, where the x-axis represents the years, the y-axis represents the values, and each line represents the value trend of a county. With ggplot, I can effectively illustrate the data in a clear and intuitive manner, also enhancing the readability and attractiveness of the visualization.


###Tidyr package - pivot_longe()

```{r}
data_long <- ev_data_wider %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -County, 
               names_to = "Year",
               values_to = "Value")
```



###ggplot2 package - ggplot()


```{r}
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = County, group = County)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = colnames(data)[-1]) + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Value", color = "County", title = "Value Trends by County") +
  theme_bw()
```
